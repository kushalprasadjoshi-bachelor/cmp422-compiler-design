# Lab 3: Token Counter for Identifiers, Keywords & Operators Using Flex 

## Objective

**To develop a lexical analyzer using Flex that scans input code and:**
- **Identifies tokens like keywords, identifiers, numbers, operators, and comments.** 
- **Counts how many of each token type appears.** 

---

## Software Requirements

| **Tools** | **Purpose** |
|-----------|-------------|
| Flex | Lexical Analyzer Generator |
| GCC | C Compiler to compile generated code |
| OS | Windows (MinGW) |

---

## Theory

The purpose of a lexical analyzer is not only to recognize tokens but also to track their frequency for further compiler stages like optimization or symbol table generation. 
In this experiment we: 
- Use regular expressions to define token types (keywords, identifiers, operators, 
etc.). 
- Maintain counters for each token type. 
- Use Flex actions { ... } to print and count each token.

## Compilation and Execution Steps

```
win_flex token-counter.l 
gcc lex.yy.c -o token-counter 
./token-counter 
```

---

## Output

```
Enter the code (Ctrl+Z then Enter to end input):
int x = 5; 
KEYWORD: int
IDENTIFIER: x
OPERATOR: =
NUMBER: 5
DELIMITER: ;

if (x > 2) x = x + 1; 
KEYWORD: if
DELIMITER: (
IDENTIFIER: x
OPERATOR: >
NUMBER: 2
DELIMITER: )
IDENTIFIER: x
OPERATOR: =
IDENTIFIER: x
OPERATOR: +
NUMBER: 1
DELIMITER: ;

^Z

-- Token Counts --
Keywords    : 2
Identifiers : 4
Numbers     : 3
Strings     : 0
Logical Ops : 0
Operators   : 4
Delimiters  : 4
Comments    : 0
Unknown     : 0
```

---

## Result

- The lex program successfully detected and printed all relevant tokens. 
- Counted token types such as keywords, operators, etc. 
- Displayed the final count summary at the end of execution. 

--- 

## Conclusion

- Understood how to use regular expressions to detect various token types. 
- Used Flex actions to maintain counters and print real-time results.
